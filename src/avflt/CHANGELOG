	- user-space <==> kernel protocol extended for cache option
	  0 - do not cache cache event result

	  when a file cannot be scanned or when an error occurred during scan.
	  In this case application can allow or deny access to the file and it
	  should set the result to not be cached. Next time the file is accessed
	  it is send again for scan instead of returning result from cache.
