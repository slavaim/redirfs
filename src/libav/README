1. Introduction

	Anti-Virus Library provides userspace interface for AVFlt. It
	communicates with AVFlt through the avflt char device. This library
	allows only to receive requests for file scan from AVFlt and send
	scan results back to AVFlt. For AVFlt settings, like which paths should
	be scanned, the libavfltctl library has to be used.
