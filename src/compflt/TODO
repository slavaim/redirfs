high:
- add cache deinitializations in compflt_init when further initialization fail

medium:
- mmap support
- compress_dir utility
- cleanup the cflt_file_handle_block function
- remove *fh from those cflt_file_* functions that can expect blk->par to be set
- debug output cleanup
- optimize writes that overwrite whole existing blocks (no need to read them)

low:
- add description to functions
- renaming cflt_file to cflt_inode makes more sense (the data is inode-specific)

feature:
- add stats directory to sysfs interface
